Title: General Weight-Loss and Healthy Eating Guidelines

1. A safe and sustainable calorie deficit for weight loss is typically around 500 kcal per day. 
   This usually results in about 0.4–0.6 kg of weight loss per week.

2. Minimum calorie levels should be respected for safety:
   - Women: not below 1200 kcal/day
   - Men: not below 1500 kcal/day
   Diets below these levels should only be followed with professional medical supervision.

3. A balanced plate should include:
   - Vegetables (fiber and micronutrients)
   - Lean protein (for muscle preservation and satiety)
   - Whole grains (slow-release energy)
   - Healthy fats in small amounts (nuts, seeds, olive oil)

4. Protein is important for maintaining lean muscle during a calorie deficit, especially when exercising.

5. Hydration plays a key role in appetite control, energy, digestion, and overall well-being.

6. Weight loss should always be combined with physical activity such as walking, strength training, or daily movement to improve results.

7. Rapid weight loss, extreme diets, or cutting entire food groups is not recommended unless guided by a clinician.

8. For individuals with high BMI (≥ 40), elderly users, or those with medical conditions, personalized clinical guidance is recommended.

9. These foundational guidelines should be used when calculating target calories and building safe meal plans.
