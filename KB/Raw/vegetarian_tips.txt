Title: Nutrition Guidelines for Vegetarian Weight-Loss Diets

1. Focus on plant-based protein sources:
   - Lentils, beans, chickpeas
   - Tofu, tempeh, soy chunks
   - Paneer, Greek yogurt (for lacto-vegetarians)

2. Vegetarian diets can be healthy for weight loss if protein needs are met and calorie-dense foods are limited.

3. Foods to limit include:
   - Deep-fried snacks, pakodas, fries
   - Excess nuts and nut butters
   - Heavy cream-based dishes
   - Highly processed vegetarian junk foods

4. Balanced vegetarian meals include:
   - A protein base (tofu, lentils, paneer)
   - Two portions of vegetables (fiber for fullness)
   - One portion of whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, millets)

5. Tips to increase satiety:
   - Use salads or soups before meals
   - Add fiber-rich vegetables to every dish
   - Drink water regularly throughout the day

6. Nutrients of interest:
   - Vitamin B12 (fortified foods or supplements if needed)
   - Iron (leafy greens + vitamin C foods)
   - Omega-3s (flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts)

7. These guidelines should be applied when creating vegetarian-specific meal plans and substitutions.
