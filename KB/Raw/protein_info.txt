Title: Protein Requirements and High-Protein Food Sources

1. Protein needs during weight loss usually range between 1.2–1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. 
   This level helps maintain muscle mass, increases satiety, and supports metabolism.

2. Benefits of higher protein intake include:
   - Reduced hunger and better appetite control
   - Improved lean muscle retention during calorie deficit
   - Higher thermic effect of food (more calories burned while digesting protein)

3. Common high-protein vegetarian foods:
   - Lentils, chickpeas, black beans
   - Tofu, tempeh, edamame
   - Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, paneer
   - Seitan and textured vegetable protein

4. Common high-protein non-vegetarian foods:
   - Chicken breast, turkey, lean beef
   - Fish such as salmon, tuna, tilapia
   - Eggs and egg whites
   - Low-fat dairy products

5. Good protein distribution across the day:
   - 20–35 grams protein per main meal
   - 10–20 grams for snacks

6. Combining plant proteins such as grains + legumes helps achieve complete amino acid profiles.

7. Protein recommendations should be adapted in meal planning to support the user’s weight-loss goals and dietary preferences.
