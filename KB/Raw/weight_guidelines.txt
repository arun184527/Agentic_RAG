Title: Weight-Based Guidelines for Weight Loss and Weight Gain

1. Weight Range: 25–30 kg (Children / Underweight Range)
   - Weight Loss: Not recommended. Children or very low-weight individuals should not follow calorie-deficit diets without clinical supervision.
   - Weight Gain: Encourage nutrient-dense foods: milk, yogurt, nut butters (in moderation), bananas, rice, potatoes, and moderate protein intake. Focus on 250–300 kcal surplus per day.

2. Weight Range: 30–35 kg (Underweight Category)
   - Weight Loss: Not applicable.
   - Weight Gain: Increase calories by 300–400 kcal/day with meals rich in whole grains, eggs (if allowed), dairy, lentils, and healthy fats. Strength exercises help build muscle.

3. Weight Range: 35–40 kg
   - Weight Loss: Not suitable unless under clinical advice.
   - Weight Gain: Balanced diet with high-quality protein (1.2–1.4 g/kg) and calorie-dense whole foods. Add 1–2 extra snacks such as yogurt, smoothies, or nuts.

4. Weight Range: 40–50 kg
   - Weight Loss: Only recommended if BMI indicates overweight. Minimum calories should follow general guidelines.
   - Weight Gain: Add 300–500 kcal/day from healthy carbohydrate sources (rice, oats), dairy, protein-rich legumes, and nut-based snacks.

5. Weight Range: 50–60 kg
   - Weight Loss: A moderate calorie deficit (300–500 kcal). Maintain protein at 1.2–1.6 g/kg.
   - Weight Gain: Increase calories by 300–400 kcal/day with focus on protein and strength training. Avoid excess junk food for healthy weight gain.

6. Weight Range: 60–70 kg
   - Weight Loss: A deficit of ~500 kcal/day works well. Include vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.
   - Weight Gain: Add 400–500 kcal/day. Include calorie-dense meals like oats with milk, paneer dishes, eggs, or chicken along with whole grains.

7. Weight Range: 70–80 kg
   - Weight Loss: Aim for 0.5 kg/week reduction. Maintain protein and reduce processed foods.
   - Weight Gain: Surplus of 300–600 kcal. Choose high-protein meals and strength training for muscle-driven weight gain.

8. Weight Range: 80–90 kg
   - Weight Loss: A 500–600 kcal deficit recommended. Prevent muscle loss with higher protein.
   - Weight Gain: If underweight for height, use a controlled surplus of 400 kcal/day with balanced macros.

9. Weight Range: 90–100 kg
   - Weight Loss: Maintain safe calorie levels (1200–1500 minimum). Increase activity level gradually.
   - Weight Gain: Only if clinically required. Focus should remain balanced and healthy.

10. Weight Range: 100–120 kg
   - Weight Loss: A structured plan with safe deficit. Emphasize vegetables, lean protein, hydration, and reduced refined carbs.
   - Weight Gain: Rarely applicable; only under medical guidance.

11. Weight Range: 120–140 kg
   - Weight Loss: Recommend consistent deficit, high fiber, and protein. Avoid extreme diets. Monitor for metabolic issues.
   - Weight Gain: Not recommended unless severe medical condition exists.

12. Weight Range: 140–160 kg
   - Weight Loss: High BMI may require supervised plan. Focus on sustainable calorie reduction, walking, and whole foods.
   - Weight Gain: Not suitable.

13. Weight Range: 160–180 kg
   - Weight Loss: Emphasize safety. A moderate deficit with professional consultation is ideal. Avoid rapid weight-loss methods.
   - Weight Gain: Not applicable.

14. Weight Range: 180–200 kg
   - Weight Loss: Needs carefully planned deficit. Increase protein for satiety and muscle retention. Limit sugary and fried foods.
   - Weight Gain: Not applicable.

15. General Notes:
   - Weight loss should be slow and sustainable.
   - Weight gain should focus on muscle, not fat.
   - Strength training benefits both weight loss and weight gain by improving body composition.
   - Users with extreme weight ranges (under 40 kg or above 120 kg) may require special clinical guidance.
